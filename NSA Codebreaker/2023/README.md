# NSA Codebreaker 2023

In this year's NSA Codebreaker challenges, I was able to complete tasks 1-3, but was unable to complete task 4, and any subsequent tasks. You will find each task inside its respective folder.

### Note

I completed this challenge a while back, so some of the files or solutions may be missing, as I may have lost them. I will do my best to provide the solutions I have.

## Task 1

The solution to task 1 can be found in the [Task 1 code folder](Task%201/Code%20Solution/sql-execution.sql).

## Task 2

Unfortunately, I lost the diagram and/or video I made explaining the solution to task 2.

## Task 3

The solution to task 3 can be found in the [Task 3 code folder](Task%203/Solution%Video).

As a note, I'm unsure where the little badge indicating I completed this task went.
